# CreativeProject4
Last Creative project for CS 260


Mongo -- Database

multiple collections

collection for all the books
collection for all the reviews


This is a creative project, so you are welcome to build what you would like. The basic requirements are:

The site uses Vue CLI for the front end
The site uses Node, Express, and Mongo on the back end
The site uses an API between the front end and back end, and supports create, read, update, and delete operations
The site has multiple pages (multiple views in the Router)
The site contains a footer that links to your public GitHub repository
In addition, the site should have a robust data model. Ideally, this should be multiple collections of documents and a detailed schema for each collection. For example, if you were building a recipe site, you could have a collection for recipes and for people. The recipes should have a robust schema, such as name, description, ingredient list, photo. The people should have a robust schema, such as name, interests, favorite recipes, etc.  You want to avoid having an overly simplistic site.

The GitHub repository should be in your own GitHub account.


Please submit to Canvas the URL for your web server, where your code is running (e.g. on your DigitalOcean server). On this website, in a footer, you must include a link to your GitHub repository. Use a unique URL for the project, e.g. cp3.emmasmith.org.

If you worked with a pair programming partner, both of you should submit the assignment and both of you should list the other person's name in the website footer and in the assignment submission.

We will grade your projects based on:

you used the Vue CLI for the front end, with multiple pages
you used Node, Express, and Mongo for the back end,
you have an API that includes creating, reading, updating and deleting data on the back end,
you have a robust data model,
how well you follow web design principles: spacing, typography, color, consistency, and responsive design.
TAs will assign scores in these ranges:

90-100: Excellent use of Vue CLI, Node, Express, and Mongo, robust data model, and clearly follows web design principles
80-90: Uses Vue CLI, Node, Express and Mongo, good effort was made, but needs a little richer data model or a more complete API or web design principles were completely ignored
70-80: Fulfills the minimum requirement of using Vue CLI, Node, Express, and Mongo, but the site, data model, and/or API are too simple
